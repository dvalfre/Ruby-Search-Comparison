== Ruby Search Comparison

I wanted to know the relative speed difference between Sunspot with Solr
and Thinking Sphinx. In order to gauge that, I wrote this little and
potentially silly benchmark rails application.

You can download the source for this benchmark at:
https://github.com/vijedi/Ruby-Search-Comparison

Running the benchmark requires Rails3. I use PostgreSQL so all the 
current configs make use of those configurations.

This benchmark loads in Cory Doctorow's "Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom"
and inserts segments into the database along with a random first and last name.

Running the benchmark searches for 50,000 random words from this text and 
will print out the current timing results after every 5,000 searches.

To run this benchmark for one of the search backends do:

== For Thinking Sphinx

- git checkout origin thinking_sphinx
- bundle install 
- update the database settings
- rake db:create db:migrate 
- edit config/sphinx.yml (if running the search on a different box)
- rake thinking_sphinx:index
- rake thinking_sphinx:start
- rake bench:run
